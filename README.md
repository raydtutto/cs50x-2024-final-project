# Endless Match3

### Description:

This project is my [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) final submission: a simple yet engaging Match3 puzzle 
game developed with the **Godot Engine** and written in **GDScript**. The game demonstrates the programming and 
problem-solving skills I gained throughout the course.

### Classic gameplay
- Match three or more tiles of the same type to score points.
- Tiles fall into place after matches, with new tiles spawning to keep the board full.
