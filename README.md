# Endless Match3

### Description:

This project is my [CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2024/) final submission: a simple Match3 puzzle 
game developed with the **Godot Engine 4.3** and written in **GDScript**. The game demonstrates the programming and 
problem-solving skills I gained throughout the course.

### Classic gameplay
- Match three or more tiles of the same type to score points.
- Tiles fall into place after matches, with new tiles spawning to keep the board full.

### Links
- Play the game on [itch.io](https://raydtutto.itch.io/cs50x-fp-match3)
- Gameplay video on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/shorts/FJI9hOVIjZY).

## ‚ú® Key Features

### Scenes
1. **Homepage**:
    - Displays the best score.
2. **Game Board**:
    - Allows users to toggle background music on or off.
    - Interactive tile-based gameplay with smooth animations.
    - Ability to easily adjust height and columns through the engine without any hassle.

### Controls

- Fully resizable to support both vertical and horizontal orientations without breaking proportions.

### User Experience
- Prevents multiple simultaneous clicks.
- Restricts interaction to left mouse clicks for desktops.
- Disables board interaction during animations to ensure smooth gameplay.
- Ensures the board is not generated without matches.
- Shuffles the board if no possible matches are available.
- Once the maximum score is reached, further score updates are disabled.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies Used
- **[Godot Engine 4](https://godotengine.org/)** ‚Äî a free and open-source game engine for creating 2D and 3D games.
- **GDScript** ‚Äî the scripting language used in Godot to implement game logic.

## üìÅ Project Structure
- **/assets**: Sprites, fonts, background music and sound effects.
- **/scenes**: Godot generated scene files for Homepage and Game Board.
- **/scripts**: GDScript files for core game logic.
- **project.godot**: Godot project.
- **endless_match3.zip**: Archived project on the off-chance.

### Scenes
- **/items**: 5 tile items with sprites inside.
- **/levels**: Level scene with score, buttons and where board is generating itself.
- **/tiles**: Tile white background.
- **game.tscn**: The main project scene with level holder and the HUD scene inside.
- **HUD.tscn**: Homepage scene, where user can start the game and view the score.
- **tile_bg.tscn**: Tile background holder, that loads files from "/tiles".

### Scripts Description

#### 1. `game.gd`
**Purpose**: Manages the core gameplay mechanics, such as initializing the game board, handling tile swaps, checking for matches, updating scores, and refreshing the board with new tiles.

**Key Details**:
- Handles player interactions like taps and swipes.
- Implements logic to detect and resolve matches.
- Contains functions for updating the game state, animations for tile movement, and scoring.

#### 2. `grid_container.gd`
**Purpose**: Likely handles the organization and display of game tiles within a grid layout. This file might also ensure proper alignment and spacing of game items.

**Key Details**:
- Manages grid-based operations for tiles.
- Could provide utility functions for layout or interaction purposes.

#### 3. `HUD.gd`
**Purpose**: Manages the Heads-Up Display, including user interface elements like the score display, buttons, and animations for transitions or notifications.

**Key Details**:
- Initializes UI components, such as labels and buttons.
- Plays animations for appearing UI elements.
- Emits signals to start the game and retrieves the best score from stored data.

#### 4. `item_property.gd`
**Purpose**: Defines enums and properties for items, such as color types and touch gestures. It acts as a data structure for item characteristics.

**Key Details**:
- Defines `ItemTypes` for color categorization (e.g., BLUE, GREEN, RED, YELLOW, VIOLET).
- Enumerates touch directions for swipe interactions.
- Provides reusable properties for game logic.

#### 5. `item.gd`
**Purpose**: Represents an individual game tile, including its appearance, position, and interaction logic. It also handles animations and touch-based input.

**Key Details**:
- Manages the creation of tile items and their placement on the board.
- Detects and handles player interactions like taps and swipes.
- Handles animations for item movement, appearance, and match confirmations.

#### 6. `level.gd`
**Purpose**: Controls the level-related logic, such as managing the board, buttons, and sound settings. Handles scene transitions and animations for level elements.

**Key Details**:
- Sets up and controls buttons like "Home" and "Sound."
- Toggles audio settings and changes button icons.
- Transitions back to the main menu when the home button is pressed.
